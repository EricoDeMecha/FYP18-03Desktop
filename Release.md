# Release procedure

CXFreeze installer has been chosen for the  creation of the installer for this application.
This is initiated by a setup script that can be invoked using the following command:
```bash
python setup.py build
```
This will create program files in a build directory within the application. This might be incovenient 
someone who does not want any fuss while running the application. To aid with that, a portable application
can be created using the InnoSetup setup script.

### Portable installer

```ini
